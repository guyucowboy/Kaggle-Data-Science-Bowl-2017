How to download the data file in Kaggle.com easily:
1. export the Chrome cookie for Kaggle.com by using the Chrome extension (make sure you login when export the cookie and accept the terms before downloading)
the Chrome cookie extension could be found here:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookietxt-export/lopabhfecdfhgogdbojmaicoicjekelh

2. Transfer the generated cookie txt file to the computing cluster

3. In the terminal, type command similar to "wget -x -c --load-cookies cookies.txt -P data -nH --cut-dirs=5 https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/download/trainLabels.csv.zip" Only need to change the cookie file name and the download url

4. After downloading successfully, a data folder will be created and the file will be in the data folder

5. Change the file name to whatever you want


6. if it is .7z file, use "7za x myfiles.7z" to unzip (option x means to keep the origional directory. option e means ignore the origional directory)


7. To run non-interactive job, use "qsub", details to follow the instruction on BU SCC. Command currently I use:
"qsub firstPass.sh"
Write your own .sh script for your job, the script I use:


8. To run interactive job, use "qsh", details to follow the instruction on BU SCC. Command currently I use:
"qsh -l h_rt=60:00:00 = -m e -pe omp 16"

In order to make tensorflow work properly on the SCC, the following command need to be used before running the program:
1. module load cuda/8.0
2. module load cudnn/5.1
3. module load python/3.6.0
4. module load tensorflow/r1.0_python-3.6.0
